# Arch Configuration
## [ i3 | alacritty | zsh | picom | polybar ]

This repo contains configuration files for a minimalist arch setup; each folder corresponds to a tool:

i3: minimalist window manager
alacritty : lightweight terminal emulator
zsh : z shell
picom : compositor for X11, used in this configuration to provide opacity to terminals
polybar: highly customizable status bar

all configurations files, except for the zsh configuration (~/.zshrc) should be in places in the ~/.config/ directory, you should create a directory for every tool
example: 

```
~/.config/i3
~/.config/alacritty
~/.config/picom
~/.config/polybar
~/.zshrc

```
